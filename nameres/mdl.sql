/* The following function is a liability, but also a great expedient.  The view
 * mdl_results contains a GROUP BY in its definition.  Because of
 * that, when it is queried with a WHERE clause, the WHERE predicate is treated
 * like a HAVING clause in the view definition.  If the predicate contains a
 * subquery, the PostgreSQL planner will not push the predicate down into the
 * view definition's WHERE.  In the case where we'd like to run only on some
 * subset of fields, as defined by a predicate on local_fields, this is the
 * only way to push that join deep into the plan and thereby avoid computing
 * all the results before applying the predicate.
